# Maizzle Postmark Starter

The transactional email templates by [Postmark](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates), built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com).

## Variations

Each template comes in three different generic layout variations: Basic, Basic full, and Plain. This gives you a starting point so that you can customize your templates to match your brand.
